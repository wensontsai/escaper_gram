Escapergram !

This is a photographic exploration tool built in Ruby-On-Rails, JavaScript, and Postgres
that kicks off with a 3D map (D3.js) for country select,
before putting you on the ground within a 5 mile radius of the clicked location (Google Maps API)
where the most recently uploaded Instagram photos can be explored as a feed (Instagram API).
Users can save favorite 'escapes' and backtrack through the last 24 hours to see what's been happening in that locale.
